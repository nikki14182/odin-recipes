            <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk or cream</li>

            <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>24 crisp chocolate chip cookies</li>
            <li>⅓ cup melted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cheesecake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>24 ounces cream cheese softened</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Cookie Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter with a hand mixer until fluffy. Add brown sugar and continue beating until combined. Mix in milk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add flour a little bit at a time until incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips. Scoop into heaping teaspoon-sized balls and place onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Refrigerate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cookie Crust</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse the cookies in a food processor to create crumbs.</li>
            <li>Combine all crust ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Press into a 9" springform pan on the bottom and sides. Refrigerate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cheesecake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating until just until incorporated (do not overbeat, this will cause cracks).</li>
            <li>Toss 1 cup of the cookie dough balls in 1 tablespoon of flour (set aside the remainder of the cookie dough for decorating). Shake off the excess flour and fold the cookie dough into the cheesecake batter.</li>
            <li>Pour cheesecake into the prepared crust. </li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the center is just set.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven off, open the door slightly and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1 hour. Gently run a knife around the edge of the crust to loosen.</li>
            <li>Remove springform pan and cool completely in the fridge at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Top with the reserved cookie dough and garnish with whipped cream if desired.</li>
        </ol>
