# Odin Recipes

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a recipe webpage utilizing HTML. My project includes three recipes that users can select from and learn about how to prepare each meal. One of the challenges I faced while creating this webpage was inserting pictures into each recipe page. I was able to overcome this challenge by utilizing resources such as Stack Overflow and The Odin Project.
